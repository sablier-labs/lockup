This package contains the following protocols:

## Sablier Bob

Price-gated vault protocol for conditional token releases with optional yield generation.

### Protocol Overview

Bob enables entering ERC-20 tokens into vaults that release based on price conditions. Key features:

- **Price-gated vaults**: Tokens locked until target price reached (SETTLED) or expiry passes (EXPIRED)
- **Oracle integration**: Chainlink-compatible price feeds with manual sync
- **Yield adapters**: Optional Lido integration for staking deposited tokens (WETH -> wstETH)
- **Comptrollerable**: Admin functions and fee collection via comptroller contract

Uses singleton architecture - all vaults managed in `SablierBob` contract.

### Key Concepts

- **Vault ID**: Unique identifier for each vault
- **Vault Status**: Three states — `ACTIVE` (accepting deposits), `SETTLED` (synced price >= target), `EXPIRED` (expiry time passed). Both SETTLED and EXPIRED allow redemption.
- **Share Token**: `BobVaultShare` ERC-20 minted per vault on `enter()` (1:1 with deposited tokens). Transfers trigger `onShareTransfer()` to sync adapter attribution.
- **Grace Period**: 4-hour window from first deposit. Only the original depositor can exit and reclaim tokens (non-transferable). Protection against misconfigured oracles. For adapter vaults, Curve slippage may reduce the refund.
- **Manual Settlement**: Vaults do NOT auto-settle. Someone must call `syncPriceFromOracle()`, `enter()`, or `redeem()` to update `lastSyncedPrice`. Once synced at/above target, the vault stays SETTLED permanently even if the live price drops.
- **Adapter**: Optional yield strategy (currently Lido). Yield fee is snapshotted at vault creation and immune to later changes.

### Key Functions

- **`enter()`**: Deposit tokens into a vault, receive share tokens
- **`exitWithinGracePeriod()`**: Exit within grace period (no fee, original depositor only)
- **`syncPriceFromOracle()`**: Anyone can call to update vault price from oracle
- **`redeem()`**: Burn shares for tokens after settlement/expiry. Non-adapter vaults require ETH fee via `msg.value` (minimum threshold). Adapter vaults deduct yield fee from staking rewards.
- **`unstakeTokensViaAdapter()`**: Anyone can call on a non-active adapter vault to unstake all tokens before individual redemptions

## Sablier Escrow

Over-the-counter (OTC) token swap protocol that allows users to swap ERC-20 tokens with each other.

### Key Concepts

- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order
- **Order Status**: Four states — `OPEN`, `FILLED`, `CANCELLED`, `EXPIRED`
- **Seller**: The address that created the order and deposited the sell token
- **Buyer**: The address that filled the order. `address(0)` means open order (anyone can fill); specific address means private order.
- **Sell Token**: The ERC-20 token being sold, deposited by the seller when the order is created
- **Buy Token**: The ERC-20 token the seller wants to receive
- **Sell Amount**: The amount of sell token that the seller is willing to exchange
- **Min Buy Amount**: The minimum amount of buy token that the seller is willing to accept. Buyer can pay more for price improvement.
- **Expiry Time** (`expiryTime`): The Unix timestamp when the order expires. `0` means the order never expires.
- **Trade Fee**: Percentage fee (max 2%) deducted from both sell and buy amounts on fill. Sent to comptroller contract.
