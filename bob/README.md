# Sablier Bob

This package contains the following protocols:

- [Sablier Bob](./src/SablierBob.sol): Price-gated vaults that unlock deposited tokens based on a target price set. If a vault is configured with an adapter, the protocol will automatically stake the tokens and earn yield on behalf of the users.
- [Sablier Escrow](./src/SablierEscrow.sol): A peer-to-peer token swap protocol that allows users to swap ERC-20 tokens with each other.
