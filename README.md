This repository contains the core smart contracts of the Sablier V2 Protocol. For higher-level logic, see the
[sablierhq/v2-periphery](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-periphery) repository.

In-depth documentation is available at [docs.sablier.com](https://docs.sablier.com).

## Background

Sablier is a smart contract protocol that enables trustless streaming of ERC-20 assets. In this context, streaming means
the ability to make payments by the second.

Currently, the protocol offers a single type of stream, called a lockup stream. In a lockup stream, the stream creator
locks up a specified amount of ERC-20 assets in a contract. The recipient of the stream can then withdraw the assets
gradually over time. The streaming rate is determined by multiple factors, including the start and end times, and the
total amount of assets locked up.

## Install

### Foundry

First, run the install step:

```sh
forge install sablierhq/v2-core
```

Your `.gitmodules` file should now contain the following entry:

```toml
[submodule "lib/v2-core"]
  branch = "main"
  path = "lib/v2-core"
  url = "https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core"
```

Finally, add this to your `remappings.txt` file:

```text
@sablier/v2-core/=lib/v2-core/src/
```

### Hardhat

Sablier V2 Core is available as an npm package:

```sh
pnpm add @sablier/v2-core
```

## Usage

This is just a glimpse of Sablier V2 Core. For more code snippets, see the [documentation](https://docs.sablier.com).

```solidity
import { ISablierV2LockupLinear } from "@sablier/v2-core/interfaces/ISablierV2LockupLinear.sol";

contract MyContract {
  ISablierV2LockupLinear lockupLinear;

  function doSomethingWithLockupLinear() external {
    // ...
  }
}
```
