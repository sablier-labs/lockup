This repository contains the core smart contracts of the Sablier V2 Protocol. For higher-level logic, see the
[sablierhq/v2-periphery](https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-periphery) repository.

In-depth documentation is available at [sablier-v2-docs.vercel.app](https://sablier-v2-docs.vercel.app/).

## Background

Sablier is a smart contract protocol that enables trustless streaming of ERC-20 assets. In the context of Sablier,
streaming means the ability to make payments by the second.

The protocol features a type of stream called a lockup stream, in which the sender locks up a specified amount of ERC-20
assets in a contract. Subsequently, the contract progressively allocates these assets to the designated recipient, who
can access them as they become available. The streaming rate is influenced by various factors, including the start and
end times, as well as the total amount of assets locked up.

## Install

### Foundry

First, run the install step:

```shell
forge install sablierhq/v2-core
```

Your `.gitmodules` file should now contain the following entry:

```toml
[submodule "lib/v2-core"]
  branch = "main"
  path = "lib/v2-core"
  url = "https://github.com/sablierhq/v2-core"
```

Finally, add this to your `remappings.txt` file:

```text
@sablier/v2-core/=lib/v2-core/src/
src/=src/
```

### Hardhat

Sablier V2 Core is available as a Node.js package:

```shell
pnpm add @sablier/v2-core
```

## Usage

This is just a glimpse of Sablier V2 Core. For more guides and examples, see the
[documentation](https://docs.sablier.com).

```solidity
import { ISablierV2LockupLinear } from "@sablier/v2-core/interfaces/ISablierV2LockupLinear.sol";

contract MyContract {
  ISablierV2LockupLinear sablier;

  function buildSomethingWithSablier() external {
    // ...
  }
}
```
