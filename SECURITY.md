# Security

Ensuring the security of the Sablier Protocol is our utmost priority. We have dedicated significant efforts towards the
design and testing of the protocol to guarantee its safety and reliability. However, we are aware that security is a
continuous process. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please read the
[Bug Bounty Program](https://sablier.notion.site/bug-bounty) and share a report privately with us.

## Common Protocol Assumptions

All Sablier protocols have been developed with a number of common technical assumptions in mind. For a disclosure to
qualify as a vulnerability, it must adhere to these assumptions:

- The total supply of any ERC-20 token remains below 2<sup>128</sup> - 1, i.e., `type(uint128).max`.
- The `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods of any ERC-20 token strictly reduce the sender's balance by the transfer
  amount and increase the recipient's balance by the same amount. In other words, tokens that charge fees on transfers
  are not supported.
- An address' ERC-20 balance can only change as a result of a `transfer` call by the sender or a `transferFrom` call by
  an approved address. This excludes rebase tokens, interest-bearing tokens, and permissioned tokens where the admin can
  arbitrarily change balances.
- The token contract is not an ERC-20 representation of the native token of the chain. For example, the
  [$POL token](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010) on Polygon is not supported.
- The token contract has only one entry point.
- The token contract does not allow callbacks (e.g., ERC-777 is not supported).

## Airdrops

Sablier Airdrops has been developed with the following additional assumptions:

- Campaign creator does not fund an Airdrop campaign contract before deploying it through the Sablier Merkle Factory.

## Flow

Flow has been developed with the following additional assumptions:

- A trust relationship is formed between the sender, recipient, and depositors participating in a stream. The recipient
  depends on the sender to fulfill their obligation to repay any debts incurred by the Flow stream. Likewise, depositors
  trust that the sender will not abuse the refund function to reclaim tokens.
- The token contract must implement `decimals()` with an immutable return value.
- The token contract's `decimals()` function must not return a value higher than 18.
- The `depletionTimeOf` function depends on the stream's rate per second. Therefore, any change in the rate per second
  will result in a new depletion time.
- There could be a minor discrepancy between the actual streamed amount and the expected amount. This is due to `rps`
  being an 18-decimal number, while users provide the amount per interval in the UI. If `rps` had infinite decimals,
  this discrepancy would not occur.
- When withdrawing from multiple streams using `batch` function, the minimum fee required to execute the batch is equal to
  the minimum fee required to withdraw from a single stream. This is intentional and expected behavior.

## Lockup

Sablier Lockup has been developed with the following additional assumptions:

- The number of segments/tranches should be such that creating a stream should not lead to an overflow of the block gas
  limit.
- There is no need for exponents greater than ~18.44 in `LockupDynamic` segments.
- Recipient contracts on the hook allowlist have gone through due diligence and are assumed to expose no risk to the
  Sablier protocol.
- When withdrawing from multiple streams either using `batch` or `withdrawMultiple` function, the minimum fee required to
  execute the transaction is equal to the minimum fee required to withdraw from a single stream. This is intentional
  and expected behavior.
